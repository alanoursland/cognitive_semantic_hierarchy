**1.  Modular CSHN with Iterative Processing:**

Instead of viewing the CSHN as a strict feedforward hierarchy, we can think of it as a collection of *modules*, each responsible for a specific aspect of spatial reasoning.  Each module can have its own internal recurrent loop, representing a "cycle of thought" that refines its output before passing it to the next module.

**2.  Formalizing the "Cycle of Thought":**

We can represent the internal processing within each module \(M_i\) as a recurrent function:

```
z_i(t+1) = f_i(z_i(t), z_{i-1}(t),  θ_i)
```

Where:

* \(z_i(t)\) is the module's internal state at time step *t*.
* \(z_{i-1}(t)\) is the input from the previous module.
* \(θ_i\) are the module's learned parameters.
* \(f_i\) is the recurrent function (e.g., a recurrent neural network, a transformer, or even a simpler iterative update rule).

This equation describes how each module iteratively updates its internal state based on its previous state and the input from the preceding module.  The "cycle of thought" is represented by the repeated application of \(f_i\) until a certain criterion is met.

**3. Confidence-Based Passing:**

You mentioned "reaching some level of confidence."  This is a crucial point.  Each module should have a mechanism for determining when it has reached a stable or confident state.  This could be implemented in several ways:

* **Convergence Criterion:**  Monitor the change in the module's internal state over time. When the change falls below a threshold, the module is considered to have converged.
* **Confidence Score:**  Learn a separate function that estimates the confidence of the module's output.  This function could take as input the module's internal state and output a score between 0 and 1.  The module would then pass its output to the next module only when the confidence score exceeds a certain threshold.
* **Attention Mechanism:** Use an attention mechanism to dynamically control the number of iterations. The attention mechanism could attend to the module's internal state and decide when it has processed the information sufficiently.

**4.  Connecting Modules:**

The modules are connected in a sequence, but the passing of information is now conditional:

```
z_i = g_i(z_{i-1})  if Confidence_i(z_i) > Threshold_i
```

Where:

* \(g_i\) is a (potentially learned) function that processes the output from the previous module before it is passed to the current module.
* `Confidence_i` is the confidence function for module *i*.
* `Threshold_i` is the confidence threshold for module *i*.

**5.  Training with Backpropagation:**

Even with this iterative and conditional structure, the entire system can still be trained using backpropagation.  The gradients can flow back through the recurrent loops within each module and across the connections between modules.  However, the conditional passing of information requires careful handling.  Techniques like straight-through estimators or reinforcement learning methods might be necessary to train the confidence functions.

**6.  Benefits of this View:**

* **Adaptive Processing:**  Each module can spend more time processing complex inputs and less time on simpler ones.  This leads to more efficient use of computational resources.
* **Robustness to Noise:**  The iterative processing within each module can help to filter out noise and improve the robustness of the system.
* **Emergent Behavior:**  The interaction between the modules can lead to emergent behavior that is not explicitly programmed.  For example, the system might learn to focus its attention on different aspects of the input depending on the task.
* **Closer to Cognitive Processing:**  This view is more aligned with how cognitive processes are believed to work in the brain.  Cognitive processes are often iterative and involve feedback loops between different brain regions.

**7.  Example - Route Planning:**

Imagine the Route Level. Instead of generating a complete route in one go, it could:

1. Start with a very rough, high-level plan (e.g., "go generally north").
2. Iteratively refine this plan, considering local details (e.g., "turn left at the next intersection").
3. The Metric Level provides feedback ("that intersection is blocked").
4. The Route Level iterates again, adjusting the plan ("go straight instead").
5. Only when the Route Level is confident in a segment of the route does it pass this information to the next level (perhaps the motor control level for a robot).

**8.  Open Questions:**

* How to design the confidence functions effectively?
* How to choose the right number of iterations for each module?
* How to train the system efficiently with the conditional passing of information?
* How to analyze the emergent behavior of the system?

By thinking of the CSHN as a collection of interconnected modules with iterative "cycles of thought," we can create a more flexible, robust, and cognitively plausible model of intelligence.
